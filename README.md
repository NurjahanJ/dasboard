# Essential Question
* How has inflation impacted housing prices in different U.S. States over the past decade?
* Theory: If the inflation rate increases then the housing prices would also increase.

## Visualization
* Inflation Rate Changes Over Time (Line Chart):
  * Displays the trend in inflation rates over the years for each selected state.
  * Each line represents a state; hovering reveals the precise inflation rate for that year.

* Relationship Between Housing Prices and Inflation (Scatter Plot):
  * Illustrates the correlation between housing prices (HPI) and inflation rates.
  * Each point corresponds to a specific year in a state; hover details show HPI and inflation values.

* Housing Price Index Heat Map:
  * Presents a color-coded grid of HPI values across states (x-axis) and years (y-axis).
  * Darker colors denote higher HPI; hovering over a cell reveals the exact HPI value.

* Average Housing Price Index by State (Bar Chart):
  * Ranks states based on their average HPI over the selected period.
  * Bars display average HPI values via hover tooltips, enabling easy comparison across states
